Due to memory size limit for submission. I emptied the results file which originally contained all the plots (for fitting, residuals and SVI surface) and metrics data.

You could refer to src/Test_2025-04-08.ipynb to see the demo results.

Also, just click to run the src/workflow.py file, you will be able to attain all the results files in the results directory.

More details can be seen in README file.
